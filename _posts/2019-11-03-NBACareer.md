## The Vision
We needed create an MVP in a week. This MVP needeed to contain a working frontend, backend, and database to predict the longevity of a player
and find the most similar player.

## Data Science Team
This was an interesting build. We used a Postgres DB and wrote SQL queries as endpoints to communicate with the frontend. Using an xgboost regressor
and training, validating and testing on web scraped data, we were able to create an application that can predict a NBA player's time in the NBA by + or - 1.44 years

## The End Result
The [NBA Career Predictor](https://nba-clp.netlify.com/login) is a working application that predicts how many years a player will stay in the NBA
and the most similar player.

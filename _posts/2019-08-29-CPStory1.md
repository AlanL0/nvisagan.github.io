This is my first attempt at Data Analysis using Python (Pandas) and Seaborn for visualizations. I wanted to answer the question "Can the age of a wife and the number of children she has given birth affect the type of contraceptive she would like to use?" 
Using the data from UC Irvine's database, I looked at 1500 data values from wives' that chose to either not use a contraceptive, use a short-term contraceptive, or use a long term contraceptive.

## Welcome!

Welcome to my **Personal Portfolio**. Its a showcase of all my projects as well an open door to my thought process. 

My name is Navo Visagan, a student currently learning the intricacies of data science and machine learning. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering at UC Irvine and am currently doing a Master's of Computer Information Systems at CSULA. From a young age, I was always tinkering around technology. Growing up, I found ways to make something do something else like using a Wiimote as a controller for a iPod touch(_because my big hands made it uncomfortable to play_) or modifying game consoles for fun and _because I didn't get allowance_. My grandparents were also esteemed doctors so I grew up around people practicing medicine. As I grew, I wanted to explore the combined world of medicine and technology. Now I am building the necessary skills to traverse this "world"

This website is a journal of this journey.

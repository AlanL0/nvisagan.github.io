## Welcome to my personal portfolio!

My name is Navo Visagan, a student currently learning about the world of data science and machine learning. I gradauted with a Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering at UC Irvine an am currently doing a Masters of Computer Information Systems at CSULA. From a young age, I was always tinkering around technology. Growing up, I founds ways to make something do something else like using a Wiimote as a contoller for a Ipod touch or modifying game consoles for fun. My granparents were also doctors so I became fascinated about medicine. As I grew older, I knew I wanted combine the world of medicine and the world of technology.

This website is a telling of this journey. Learning never stops.
